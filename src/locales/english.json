    "description": "Hello, I'm Alexander! I am passionate about development, particularly front-end applications. Over the years, I have worked with a wide range of technologies, and I have gained excellent knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Currently, my preferred tool is Vue.js, and I enjoy building engaging and user-friendly applications with it. \\n As a social person, I value communication and teamwork. I am actively seeking a full-time position with a team that shares my passion for simplifying everyday tasks and making life and business more productive and convenient. \\n In my previous roles, I have gained practical experience working within a team using Agile/Scrum methodology. I thrive on complex and non-standard tasks, and I am a fast learner, always eager to learn new things.\\n If you are looking for a talented front-end developer to join your team, I believe I would be a valuable addition. Please feel free to reach out to me to discuss how I can help you achieve your goals.",
